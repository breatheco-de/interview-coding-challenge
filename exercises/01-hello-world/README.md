# `01` First Exercise

We created this first exercise as an example, you can find it located in the folder `./01-hello-world`.

1. Every exercise must be located on a separate folder and it must have a README.md file inside with the exercise instructions written in markdown.
2. You can also add a `README.[lang].md` file for translations, for example: `README.es.md` for spanish.
3. In the same folder, you will find an `app.js`file to write to solution there.

## Solving the exercise

1. Write the code that can solve the problem in each exercise (This first exercise is currently solved).
2. Every time you need, you can check if your code runs using the button `Execute` in the `Run` option (view bottom) and check the result in the console.
3. Once you have finished and your code is running and solving the problem. Press the `Test` button to verify your solution. 
4. If you get a green result, you can continue (and celebrate!).
